## What is a Token Generator?

A token generator creates random strings of characters used as unique identifiers for authentication, API keys, session tokens, and other security purposes.

## Features

### Token Generation
- Adjustable length from 1 to 512 characters
- Customizable character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Generate multiple tokens at once
- Real-time generation as settings change

### Security
- Uses secure random number generation
- Client-side generation for privacy
- Configurable complexity levels

### Interface
- Visual controls for easy configuration
- Copy functionality for generated tokens
- Refresh option for new tokens
- Responsive design

## Use Cases

- API keys for web services and applications
- Password reset verification tokens
- Session identifiers for authentication
- File upload and sharing tokens
- Database record identifiers
- Testing and development tokens

## How to Use

1. Set token length using the slider or number input (1-512 characters)
2. Choose character sets by toggling the switches
3. Tokens are generated automatically based on your settings
4. Copy tokens to clipboard or refresh to generate new ones

## Technical Details

- Character sets: uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), symbols
- Length range: 1 to 512 characters (or more)
- Generation method: secure random sampling
- Output format: plain text

## Benefits

- Client-side generation for privacy
- Fast and responsive interface
- Highly customizable settings
- Simple integration with development workflows

> **Security Notice**: For high-value production systems, always rotate tokens regularly and store them using secure hashing algorithms (bcrypt/scrypt).
